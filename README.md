# Mapping_Earthquakes
## Purpose:

The purpose of this project was to help Basil and Sahana create an interactive earthquake map to visually show the differences in magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world in the past 7 days.

## Examples

![Map 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100821974/173238343-d99a9f9e-d24b-449b-9eae-ecd14fe1f21b.png)
Map containing a color-coded key for magnitude differences, and 2 different map views.
![map 2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100821974/173238841-8627dd74-6df0-49d5-a70c-b41bf21e50f0.png)
Map that along with color-coded key and 2 different map views it also shows tectonic plate lines along with 3 different toggle views. A plain map view with earthquakes, a view showing tectonic plates, and a view of all major earthquakes.
